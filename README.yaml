  This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles and more.
  It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.

usage: |-
  At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

  ```make
  -include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://git.io/build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
  ```

  This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

  This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

  Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

  **NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

quickstart: |-
  Here's how to get started...

  1. `git clone https://github.com/getft/build-harness.git` to pull down the repository
  2. `make init` to initialize the [`build-harness`](https://github.com/getft/build-harness/)
